## Assignment #4

### READING

Overall, I agree with Lavigne's point of view. In a way, I am also a beneficiary of web scraping scripts. Before I knew how to use scraping tools, I gathered information through some open-source and third-party software. But I think it’s difficult to popularize or promote this technology so that everyone can benefit from it.

On one hand, data security policies are getting stricter. The GDPR rules enforced across the EU have had a significant impact on data collection. Actually, before I came to London, I was quite frustrated with these rules. But now I realize that different countries have very different attitudes toward data security. In any case, with GDPR in place, collecting valid data now requires more effort and cost.

On the other hand, the internet is flooded with false and outdated information. Filtering through and selecting the right information is already a hassle. Just automating the data collection part is not enough. For this technology to be widely used and spread, more comprehensive systems are needed.

In short, I think we should approach this technology with a balanced view. It is definitely an accelerator for learning and work in certain scenarios, but there are still many situations where it doesn’t work as well.

### CODING


Since it's the Chinese New Year, I’ve seen a lot of Chinese-style posters with copper coin patterns on the streets of London. So, I quickly drew a draft of a copper coin pattern in P5.

But it looked a bit too simple and dull, so I reduced some of the lines and created a pattern that looked like ginkgo tree leaves. I tried adding more details to the pattern, but I ran into some trouble with the bottom part of the leaf. I wanted to connect smooth curves along the edges and bottom, but after many attempts, I couldn’t make it work.

In the end, I gave up on the outer shape and drew a fan-shaped leaf.


But a simple pattern still felt a bit boring, so I added an effect of leaves falling. I had done something similar in a previous assignment, but this time, I added mouse interaction to simulate the effect of wind.

I’m wondering if there’s any way to visualize "wind".

I also realized a problem in this week’s assignment! I’m really not good at dealing with "class".

### REFLECTING
This week's reflection is actually about the second week's assignment. Last week, I visited the Courtauld Gallery and saw works by Georges Seurat. I realized his style is somewhat similar to my second-week assignment. He used colored dots to create his paintings, which made me think: could I add some color randomness to my original code and change the size of the circles? That might turn it into a Georges Seurat style generator.

I’m noting this down so I can try some adjustments next week.
