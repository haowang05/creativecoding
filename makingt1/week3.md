Pretty simple! Very fun!

Soldering is indeed a lot of fun. It's a pity that there aren't many soldering tasks in the lab, but I'm sure there will be plenty of opportunities to practice during the mid-project. I've discovered that not only can the serial values be changed by fully touching the copper sheet, but pressing it firmly with a finger can also have the same effect. This observation makes me think about potential ways to integrate some mechanical structures with this component in the future.

I'm also curious whether the length of the copper sheet would affect the base value. I'll look into this question in my free time.

## Reading

I myself am a beneficiary of the Remixing style of learning. Before coming to CCI, I had never studied coding or modeling in a professional system, but referencing the work of people from various backgrounds within the learning community has been an effective way for me to learn and has greatly broadened my perspective. I often find myself marveling at the realization that things can be done in such innovative ways.

Moreover, I believe that with the development of modern society, the barriers between different disciplines are gradually disappearing. There is an increasing amount of interdisciplinary collaboration and topics around us. Especially as the mediums through which people experience new things continue to evolve, I think that in the future, music, video, color, and even other sensations like smell, can all be integrated with communication media and platforms to co-create content. I look forward to all of this happening and am very eager to be part of it.

## Project Development

I carefully read through the components and practical sections of the projects in Excel. Then, I eliminated the projects based on my expertise and the ease of obtaining materials. Many of the projects are quite challenging because the documentation provided by the authors is not always very detailed, and the component links and ways to obtain materials are often briefly described.

Initially, I narrowed it down to 3 projects that I plan to test the circuit components for on Tinkercad within this week.
* https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Chandelier-from-Jars/
  * This is the project I am currently most inclined to choose. The testing of the circuit components is already underway, and I am very interested in the 74HC245D; I think this is a great opportunity to get to know this component better. I don't plan on making too many changes to the circuit components, but I might modify the mechanical structure. I really want to make this device move.
* https://www.instructables.com/The-Beauty-of-Math-Conways-Game-of-Life-Art/
  * The project is truly beautiful, but I'm not very confident that I can fully understand the 8x8 RGB WS2812 and produce something within the remaining time. However, I still bought an 8x8 RGB WS2812 because it's really cool, and I will study how to use it in my spare time.
* https://www.instructables.com/Harmonograph-1/
  * I find this project very interesting. I've seen a similar structure at a science museum before. I believe replacing some of the materials for the robotic arms could make the entire system more stable. The Arduino part is relatively straightforward, and I will also try to think about how to optimize and upgrade the mechanical structure to make it more engaging.

This week I also attended the intro for laser cutting and 3D printing, thanks to Chris. I also received a small CCI keychain. I can't wait to try out the new equipment.
