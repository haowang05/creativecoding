### Project Development

This week I started thinking about the final assignment. Among the three directions, I chose **Objects of art can inspire strong feelings**. First of all, I am a person with strong empathy, and this topic reminds me of my experience of recovering from anxiety disorder 4 years ago.

> In 2019, 301 million people in the world had an anxiety disorder, making anxiety disorders the most common of all mental disorders.
> Reference: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/anxiety-disorders

I once saw an artwork that described objects through needles. https://noma.org/exhibitions/mending-the-sky/

When I think of the word anxiety, the picture that comes to my mind is a needle about to prick a balloon. So I want to make this picture interactive with the audience by enriching the form of interactive input.
