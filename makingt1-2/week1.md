### Round 1: Game Mechanic Exploration

We started by researching various board games, initially focusing on “race-to-the-end” map-based mechanics similar to Monopoly. Ceci then proposed a portal mechanic, where players could suddenly teleport across the board, disrupting their progress. This idea sparked a lot of creative discussion, and we each decided to develop different narrative backgrounds for this mechanic.

### Round 2: Narrative Expansion & Design Pivot

We brainstormed many narrative settings—parallel universes, team adventures, and more. However, we realized such mechanics would be too complex for a one-week timeframe.  
As a result, we shifted our focus toward a **lightweight social game** with fast-paced, interactive tasks.

> **Core Gameplay**:  
> Players advance on the board by completing tasks on cards. These include:  
> - Simple move-forward instructions  
> - Dance challenges (great fun)  
> - Photo-based tasks, etc.

### Live Testing: Play Session Feedback

We invited classmates to test the game during our in-class session. Overall, the feedback was very positive—players found the tasks engaging and the atmosphere lively and enjoyable.

# Reading｜Reframing My Perspective on Games

I believe it's time to rethink what games are. Games are no longer just a form of entertainment. To me, they are **a medium of expression**, no different from books or films—just delivered through more complex, multimodal formats.

My favorite game is *Oxygen Not Included*. I played it obsessively during my undergraduate engineering studies. The game includes many engineering-related concepts, such as circuit design and logic gates.

I also admire Nintendo's creativity, especially in hardware design:
- *Ace Attorney* supports voice interaction  
- The Nintendo 3DS allows animation drawing via a stylus  
- Some 3DS models include a camera, enabling players to take photos and create with them  

To me, the 3DS is a device full of imagination and creative possibilities.

> So once again:  
> **Humans, please stop trying to define what a game is.**  
> A game is whatever the player defines it to be.
