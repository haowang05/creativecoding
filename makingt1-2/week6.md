## 🧪 Labs｜TouchDesigner Practice & Particle System

- Installed and explored **TouchDesigner** this week
- Followed this tutorial:

- Created an image-to-particle effect:

  - Particle count was kept low for performance reasons  
  - Added subtle diffusion using randomness and blend modes  
  - Despite the simplicity, the visual effect looked really cool

## Reading & Reflections – Week 05: Space & Immersion

This week’s reading focused on **space, immersion, and imaginative technologies**.

I strongly agree with *Imagination, Space, and Immersive Technologies*, which argues that **immersive tech like VR/AR is reshaping our understanding of the body, space, and imagination**.

Even though VR games are still niche, they offer a unique ability to transcend physical limitations. Two great examples:

- **Tabletop Simulator**: Enables board gaming across distances

- **Beat Saber**: Combines rhythm, motion, and stylized visuals for full-body immersion

> VR technologies are redefining how we experience the world — and I’m genuinely excited about what’s to come.

## Reading & Reflections – Week 06: Designing for Uncertainty

This week’s texts explore **how design addresses uncertainty**.

To be honest, I don’t often reflect on “the future,” whether it’s 20 years or 2 days from now. But I really resonate with *Speculative Everything*'s idea:

> **Design doesn’t always have to be useful — it should challenge, provoke, and imagine.**

For example:
- Imagining war vs actually causing war — completely different ethical implications  
- Many speculative design projects use fictional futures to help us rethink the present  
- Steve Jobs once said: *“People didn’t know they wanted a touchscreen phone until they saw the iPhone.”*

This is what I believe is one of design’s most powerful roles:  
**To help us explore alternate futures and question current norms.**
