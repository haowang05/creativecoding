### Reflecting

I believe that critical thinking is essentially a value system. This is because the development of laws related to coding progresses very slowly (historically, many laws have been born with significant lag). To prevent advanced technologies from being misused, practitioners have informally established their own set of rules to mitigate the ethical and moral risks that technology might bring. This is crucial, especially with the rapid rise of AI. For instance, creating creativity by infringing on artistsâ€™ original works has sparked ongoing debates even today. I think these discussions are a product of the intellectual interplay between Critical Engineers and Critical Artists.

I've added two new points based on my own experiences in coding:
* Point 11: ***The Critical Engineer recognizes that implementing code functionality is never enough; they must also balance user experience and assess risks that could impact the outcome.*** 
  * Programmers are often part of a team. Being in a team implies collaboration and accommodating different standards. One should not impose their professional standards on others but instead embrace the role of a contributor and supporter within the team.
* Point 12: ***The Critical Engineer anticipates potential challenges, such as technical debt and difficulties in future scalability.***
  * Much of the code we produce is built on the shoulders of giants, which is one of the key reasons for the rapid progress in computer science. Thanks to countless open-source projects, we can often reuse solutions with a simple copy-paste. Therefore, it's essential to anticipate potential risks and implement safety restrictions when editing or reusing code.

## Research

**Title:** The Listening Post

**Artists name:** Ben Rubin & Mark Hanson

**Year:** 2003

**Description:** Snippets of text are collected in real time from thousands of unrestricted Internet chat rooms, bulletin boards, and other public forums. The text is read (or sung) by a speech synthesizer and displayed simultaneously on a floating grid of more than two hundred small electronic screens.

**This work captivates me for two reasons:**
1. The piece itself conveys two profound meanings:
  * The random appearance of information captured from the internet in a shared space reflects the countless individuals behind screens yearning for connection. This sense of loneliness transcends spatial boundaries, and you can intuitively feel it through their words when standing in front of the installation.
  * User privacy has always been a hot topic. The piece highlights how our online activities are essentially public, accessible to almost anyone for virtually any purpose.
2. The scale and details of an art installation play a crucial role in its final presentation. This project employs a total of 231 electronic displays. Based on the [video released with the work](https://vimeo.com/benrubin), the dimensions of the electronic displays have been optimized. The placement is more spacious, and fewer words are displayed on each screen, enhancing the overall visual impact.
