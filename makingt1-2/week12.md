# Week 12｜Work Log


## Labs｜Shader Learning and Software Adaptation

This week focused on shaders. Although I have prior experience working at a rendering engine company and am familiar with rendering workflows, this was my **first time writing shader code directly**.

It’s been quite fascinating to reproduce familiar effects inside a **completely different software environment** (TouchDesigner), especially with a completely new UI system. It feels like relearning old concepts from a new angle.

That said, TouchDesigner’s approach to integrating non-native components can be frustrating. I’m still adjusting to its node-based logic.


## Reading & Reflections｜Interactive Storytelling and Game Evolution

This week’s readings centered around **interactive narrative**.

I resonated with **Ursula K. Le Guin’s** concept of the “carrier bag” of stories—broad, inclusive, and flexible. I truly believe that games are one of the **most powerful narrative mediums** today.

Take *itch.io* for example:  
Most projects on the platform are visual novels or small, imaginative narrative games made by indie developers. I often pick some at random just to experience their storytelling styles.

I also appreciated **Ian Cheng’s** idea of the **Infinite Game**—that a design should continuously evolve and embrace new variables.

However, I do think the concept is very abstract and hard to apply directly. It raises more questions than answers in terms of practical design strategies.


## Project Development｜Team Formation and Concept Exploration

We finalized our group this week and briefly discussed everyone’s goals for the semester:

- **Chuyao**: Wants to develop a Unity-based game. We reviewed some of his previous projects—they were incredibly fun and creative.
- **My focus**: I’m interested in exploring sound-based interaction, currently considering two directions:
  - **Voice recognition + AI**: Inspired by recent LLM experiments in Creative Coding; I want to see how natural language can integrate into gameplay
  - **Melodic interaction**: I’ve long been curious about music in games, and I’m currently learning some music theory basics. I want to see if I can make a game around melodic feedback

Despite the uncertainty, we quickly agreed that **we all want to make a puzzle-based game**, as all team members are passionate about puzzle experiences.

We also had an initial discussion on visual style.
