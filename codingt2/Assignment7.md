### READING

I think APIs are not just important in software development. They have become a big part of our daily work and life. For example, when using Notion, you can quickly reuse someone else’s template instead of starting from scratch. When editing images, you can apply LUTs to keep colors consistent without adjusting everything manually. APIs help us build on top of what others have created. More and more tools now offer template-like features to make things faster and easier.

On one hand, I benefit a lot from these APIs. But on the other hand, I sometimes worry—am I just borrowing someone else’s work and mistaking it for my own skill? APIs create a smooth and efficient world, but it’s important to remember what’s behind this convenience. At the same time, maybe this kind of self-reflection isn’t necessary at all? I always struggle with this thought.

That’s why I admire artists who bring creativity into data-driven work. For example, the article [The Rise of the Data Artist](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/05/the-rise-of-the-data-artist/392399/) shows how some artists turn raw data into beautiful, meaningful visuals. The way they take numbers and transform them into something engaging is truly impressive.

### CODING
I debated for a long time whether to complete this project in Chinese or English. Since Chinese is my mother tongue, I understand its meanings and nuances better. But at the same time, I felt unsure if people who don’t speak Chinese would fully understand it. In the end, I decided to use emojis.

I think emojis are a modern, universal language that goes beyond borders. So, I chose to use emojis to create some content.
