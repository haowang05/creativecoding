### READING
Czetwertynski says that new media art lacks criticism and believes criticism is an important tool for artistic growth. I don’t disagree. I do like art that has a critical message, no matter the medium. But I also think setting rules or forcing a purpose onto art isn’t cool. The value of art comes from the audience, not from fixed ideas.

From my experience visiting exhibitions, artworks with strong criticism often have a high entry barrier. They usually need a lot of text to explain their meaning. But new media art is supposed to be about experience, about something you feel in the moment.

For new media art, the way people experience a piece is just as important as any message behind it. Sometimes, creating a new atmosphere or a fresh visual effect is already enough.


### CODING

#### About The Final Project

**Inspiration**

This project was inspired by an artwork I saw at the National Gallery of Iceland in Reykjavík. The video had a background sound of buzzing flies. In the foreground, the artist used their tongue inside their mouth to mimic the movement of a fly. I didn’t take away any deep meaning from it. But I found one thing really interesting—the artist stared at themselves so seriously while imitating a fly. This kind of human-to-animal imitation felt oddly amusing to me.

**Theme & Concept**

Recently, MBTI personality tests have become really popular. One of the key differences is between P (Perceiving) and J (Judging) types. In simple terms, J-types like structure and control, while P-types are more flexible and spontaneous.

On social media, people seem to praise J-types more. I get why—traits like time management, discipline, and responsibility match the common idea of a “successful and efficient” person. But I’m a P-type, through and through. For a while, I tried to train myself to be more structured. But instead of becoming more productive, I lost my motivation to explore. I actually started procrastinating more.

**Final Form**

I want to use a camera to detect a person’s face and turn their facial features into mechanical gears. When the mouse hovers over the gears, they will make mechanical noises—hinting at me slowly turning into a machine. Clicking on the gears will make them disappear, revealing the original human features. But after a short time, the gears will come back. This represents my struggle in trying to become more J-like, constantly shifting between structure and freedom.
