There are 4 self-portraits in the source file. As the mouse moves to the left, the probability of the small square in 2.jpg in the picture increases.
As the mouse moves to the right, the probability of the small square in 4.jpg in the picture increases.
As the mouse moves upward, the probability of the small square in 3.jpg in the picture increases.
As the mouse moves downward, the probability of the small square in 5.jpg in the picture increases.
