## Labs

### Lab1: Hook up a servo

#### Lab1-1: Connect your Servo Motor and make it move

The various components I have come into contact with before basically interact with electrical signals. The servo is definitely a factor of change, because during the class, the teacher shared a lot of Arduino-driven devices, which contain a very rich mechanical mechanism.

This midterm project I did a very electronic project, and I hope to have the opportunity to do a very mechanical one in the future.


### Lab2: Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

Many sensors are analog signal input components, such as sound sensors and photoresistors. I think analog signals combined with different components can form a lot of interesting output forms, but the only ones I have come into contact with seem to be LEDs.


### Lab3: Motors

The DC motor seems to be very noisy when running. I don't really understand in which scenarios to use servos and in which scenarios to use DC motors in actual projects.

## Project Development

The mid-term project is finally over. This week, when I met classmates around the school, everyone talked about what project you chose and how your project is going. I tried a lot in this project and figured out the 74HC595 that I always wanted to know. Overall, I am very satisfied with my project and learned a lot from it. 

I engraved my name on the acrylic board when laser cutting. A classmate I met said to me, you must be very proud of your work. I think so. I think this little device is very cool.
