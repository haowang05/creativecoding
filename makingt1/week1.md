## Labs


### Lab 1: Installing Arduino and Completing the Blink Sketch

It was very easy to follow the instructions, but I found that it always gave an error when I connected my Arduino for the first time.

I checked and found that it was a common problem and did not affect the actual use.

It is always easy to make mistakes when wiring the switch. Later, I looked up the circuit diagram of the switch to help me truly understand how to use this component. It is easy to produce different results with different resistor positions. I feel that it is still a bit difficult for me to identify the difference in electrical signals at different positions. I think I still need more practice.

There are two important variables to control LED, one is whether it is on, and the other is the brightness. During the experiment, I connected the positive and negative poles of the LED incorrectly several times. Fortunately, my classmates helped me correct this mistake many times.
