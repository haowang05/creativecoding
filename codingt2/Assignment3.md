## Assignment #3

### READING

I have a different perspective on Metzger's auto-destructive art. First, I do recognize that auto-destructive art is a unique and powerful form of artistic expression. It can, to some extent, reflect themes like war, waste, environmental catastrophe, and the capitalist system.

However, after reviewing some of Metzger's historical works, I believe that viewers might be drawn to the visual spectacle of the self-destructive process, but they could overlook the political intent behind it. For example, using acid to corrode the canvas as a symbol of nuclear war’s destruction doesn’t directly relate to the specific pain caused by the disaster. Instead, it more immediately evokes themes like environmentalism or nature.

I feel that many of Metzger's works require long explanations or guides to be fully understood. This actually makes the art less direct in its communication. Also, many of these self-destructive pieces are only spread through images or videos, which increases the barrier for viewers to truly understand the work.

The final point that I find most difficult to understand is that Metzger often critiques the misuse of technology, yet his own art relies heavily on technological methods. For example, using acid to corrode the canvas or projectors with special equipment. Doesn’t this contradict the concept of controlling art through technology? Wouldn’t the proper logic be to criticize the dangers of technology through non-technological means? This approach could blur the message for the audience, reducing the critique to something more superficial.

   I found that by defining the direction and angle of the curve with simple parameters, I could get many different fractal effects.

### REFLECTING

Currently, the position and radius of each small circle depend only on the current depth of the fractal pattern and the next layer's depth.

I want to try storing the x, y coordinates of each layer in an array. This way, the interaction between different layers could create more interesting patterns.

Additionally, I might experiment with tying the time variable (t) to something else, like the intensity of sound. This could change the deformation speed, and it seems like a cool idea for a music interaction project.
