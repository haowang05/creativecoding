# Week 17


## Labs｜Pecha Kucha Presentation

During this week’s lab session, we participated in a Pecha Kucha showcase.  
I presented **Rusty Lake**, one of my all-time favorite puzzle games.  
The game blends surreal storytelling with escape-room-style puzzles, creating a deeply immersive experience.

## Project Development｜London Tech Week Final Checks

As London Tech Week begins next week, this week was fully dedicated to **final testing, assembly, and installation** for our exhibition piece.


### Software Team – TouchDesigner

- During Demo Day, we received useful feedback from **James and Murad**:
  - First-time visitors couldn’t immediately recognize the theme was related to the human heart
  - We explored ways to enhance visual cues and rhythm feedback

- Over the weekend, we tested the piece on-site.  
  The **actual screen was extremely large**, which required us to **recalibrate component sizes and positions** for better readability.

- During the installation process:
  - The venue’s lighting was extremely bright, making the LED strip barely visible
  - Due to this and some hardware instability, we decided to **remove the LED strip** from the final setup

- We captured some final documentation photos of the device for portfolio and promotional use
