### Project Description
 #### **What I Made** 

This final project is an exploration of critical game design and production. Through this game, I aim to present my reflections on how artists use AI tools in their creative processes. By incorporating interactions with generative art, the game seeks to highlight how AI is transforming the forms of art and redefining its boundaries.

#### **Why I Made It**

The inspiration for this project comes largely from the readings this term, which included extensive discussions about AI, as well as frequent conversations with friends about how to make better use of AI. They made me realize how deeply AI has permeated my life and learning.

I hope to contribute to broader discussions on the ethical and philosophical implications of AI in art.

In the references section, I have provided detailed sources for this project.

The inspiration for the interaction and presentation style comes from a deeply impactful game I played before, *The Shape of Time*. I found it to be a profoundly moving experience—it not only explained the concept of time in an engaging way but also encouraged players to reflect on its meaning. Despite its brevity, the game was beautifully crafted and left a lasting impression on me.

Additionally, I reviewed recent papers on generative AI to critically analyze its impact. These studies explore how generative AI is transforming lives across various fields, providing a nuanced perspective on its benefits and challenges.

Each stage and process of this game was independently designed by me. The content is presented across multiple layers, requiring asynchronous processing and display.

I utilized ChatGPT to help implement smooth transitions and interactions between these layers.

Currently, I feel the pacing of the game could be improved—it lacks fluidity. I aim to introduce more seamless transitions between different states to create a more harmonious and engaging experience for players.
