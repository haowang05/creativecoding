###  Reflections

> It was the first time for me to be involved in a real exhibition, boldly performing and speaking to the audience to tell the story of the project.üéâüéâüéâ

> A number of viewers questioned the UI's user profile data, as it is set up to be relevant to medical users, and privacy and related policies need to be considered for sensitive keywords and the collection of users' personal data.

## console.log("0xPULSE")

"console.log("0xPULSE");" is a poetic interactive art installation. When participants hold the heart rate sensor, a 3D heart suspended in mid-air pulses in sync with their real heartbeat. Surrounding streams of data suddenly accelerate‚Äîwithin those flickering lines of code lie encrypted messages that hint at technologies capable of reshaping humanity‚Äôs future. This is not only a choreography between heartbeat and algorithm, but also a gentle inquiry into the very nature of technology itself.
