# Week 4



## Labs｜Scene Integration & Functional Optimization

- This week, I merged **Jiayi's scene construction** with my **Arduino-related control components**.

- **UI Enhancements:**  
  Initially, it was difficult to control the start and restart of the game — we had to exit play mode each time.  
  After discussing with classmates in the lab, we decided to **implement UI controls** for smoother gameplay transitions.

- **Terrain Collision Optimization:**  
  Since our map is quite large, we went through all terrain elements and added **colliders**.  
  This ensures the player does not fall through gaps and stays within the playable area.

## Reading & Reflections｜Game Music & Atmosphere

We’re currently looking for appropriate background music.  
The game is likely **skiing-themed**, but it’s hard to find music that naturally evokes skiing behavior.

- My go-to royalty-free music site is: [Maou Audio](https://maou.audio/category/song/)  
  It offers a wide variety of **anime-inspired** soundtracks and sound effects, and the author actively creates free-use content.


### Music Notes from Recent Game Experiences

1. **The Rewinder (山海旅人)**
   - An indie Chinese game set in a mythological underworld
   - Uses traditional instruments to create a calm and surprisingly touching atmosphere
   - Music reacts to different story triggers and contexts
   - A pipa (琵琶) + vocal performance stood out as deeply emotional
   - Small detail: Footstep sounds change based on surface material

2. **Stardew Valley**
   - The music itself is calm and unassuming, but two moments made a strong impression:
     - The official concert tour transformed the music into something vivid and beautiful
     - I heard the "Spring Arrival" music in a random video, and it made me want to start planting — proof of subconscious behavioral associations with the soundtrack

## Minibrief｜Funnel-Inspired Architecture & Water Concept

Upon seeing the architectural sketch, we immediately associated the shape with a **funnel**, which led to exploring **water** as a design element.
