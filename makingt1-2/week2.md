## Labs｜Unity Setup & 3D Tutorial Exploration

- **Tasks Completed:**
  - Installed Unity and VS Code as the development environment  
  - Learned the basics of Unity, especially UI layout and project setup

- **Learning Resources:**
  - Unity Official Tutorials:
    - [Quick Start](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/quick-start)
    - [3D Game Kit](https://learn.unity.com/project/3d-game-kit)

- **Reflections:**
  Since we plan to develop a 3D game, I focused on relevant tutorials.  
  I highly recommend the *3D Game Kit*, which offers a comprehensive asset pack and step-by-step guides.  
  After going through the tutorial, I gained a solid understanding of the full 3D game workflow in Unity.

## Reading & Reflections｜Expanding My Understanding of “Play”

This week’s readings echoed last week’s theme:  
**Play is not just meaningful — it’s a powerful cultural experience.**

- One example that stood out to me was the **3DS audio guide at the Louvre**. For just a few euros, you can rent a 3DS with maps and artwork commentary. Using a gaming device in a museum completely transformed my visit — it became immersive and playful.

- Another example is theme parks — especially **roller coasters**. The joy comes not just from adrenaline, but from:
  - The moment of falling  
  - The reaction of nearby visitors  
  - The surrounding landscape  
  All of these are essential parts of the *experience of play*.

- This weekend, I visited the **Harry Potter Studio Tour**, which deeply impressed me.  
  You’re treated like a real Hogwarts student — visiting bedrooms, classrooms, and exploring the wizarding world.  
  It’s not just a tour. It’s a form of **spatial storytelling**, just like Hiroshi Hara’s *Play Mountain* concept.

> **This is the magic of good games — everything can be a game.**
